Human head pose estimation using Keras over TensorFlow
======================================================

Work by Rafael Berral-Soler, directed by Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez and Francisco J. Madrid-Cuevas. 
The pose estimator models developed on this project are based on the architectures on the following article:

```
M. Patacchiola y A. Cangelosi. Head pose estimation in the wild using convolutional neural networks and adaptive gradient methods. Pattern Recognition, 71, June 2017.
```

Code for this project can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s4tpcm3jx4ke33/headpose_final.zip?dl=1).

## Notes
* In order to use this model, you **MUST** import models/keras_ssd512.py, bounding_box_utils and keras_layers from the Keras implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector by Pierluigi Ferrari found [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras). These files must be placed in the root of the cloned repository directory.
* The original MatConvNet head detector model can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people), work by Pablo Medina-Suarez and Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez. It must be placed on the ``models/`` directory on the root of the cloned repository directory, and converted by running the script ``convert_ssd_512.py``.
* SSD model converter can also be obtained as a standalone software [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people_keras).
* In order to use the model and code included in this repository, it may be useful to update your PYTHONPATH. Provided you cloned this repository at ~/libs/headpose_final:

  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/libs/headpose_final/:~/libs/headpose_final/models/
  ```

## Software requirements
* OS: Ubuntu 16.04 or later (and derivatives), Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12.6 or later (no GPU support).

* TensorFlow: with or without GPU support, versi√≥n 1.14.0.
* Keras: Version 2.2.4.
* OpenCV: Version 4.1.0.25.
* Other Python libraries: glob2 (0.7), numpy (1.17.1), pandas (0.25.1), scikit-learn (0.21.3).
