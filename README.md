Human head pose estimation using Keras over TensorFlow
======================================================
![detections](https://github.com/rafabs97/headpose_final/blob/master/sample_detections.png)

Work by Rafael Berral-Soler, directed by Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez and Francisco J. Madrid-Cuevas. 
The pose estimator models developed on this project are based on the architectures on the following article:

```
M. Patacchiola y A. Cangelosi. Head pose estimation in the wild using convolutional neural networks and adaptive gradient methods. Pattern Recognition, 71, June 2017.
```

Code for this project can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s4tpcm3jx4ke33/headpose_final.zip?dl=1).

## Notes
* In order to use this model, you **MUST** import ```models/keras_ssd512.py```, ```bounding_box_utils``` and ```keras_layers``` from the Keras implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector by Pierluigi Ferrari found [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras). These files must be placed in the root of the cloned repository directory.
* The original MatConvNet head detector model can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people), work by Pablo Medina-Suarez and Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez. It must be placed on the ``models/`` directory on the root of the cloned repository directory, and converted by running the script ``convert_ssd_512.py``.
* SSD model converter can also be obtained as a standalone software [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people_keras).
* In order to use the model and code included in this repository, it may be useful to update your PYTHONPATH. Provided you cloned this repository at ~/libs/headpose_final:

  ```
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/libs/headpose_final/:~/libs/headpose_final/models/
  ```

## Quick Start Guide
* Clone this repository to a directory of your choice.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/rafabs97/headpose_final <directory>
  ```
* Place ```models/keras_ssd512.py```, ```bounding_box_utils``` and ```keras_layers``` from [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras) at the root of the cloned repository directory.
* Place ```models/head-detector.mat``` from [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people) on the ``models/`` directory on the root of the cloned repository directory.
* Run the script  ``convert_ssd_512.py``.
* Run the script ``demo_image.py``. The output should match the demo output at the top of this page.
