Human head pose estimation using Keras over TensorFlow
======================================================

Code for this project can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7s4tpcm3jx4ke33/headpose_final.zip?dl=1).

# Notes
* In order to use this model, you **MUST** import models/keras_ssd512.py, bounding_box_utils and keras_layers from its [repository](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras), from the Keras implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector by Pierluigi Ferrari found [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras). These files must be placed in the root of the cloned repository directory.
* The original MatConvNet head detector model can be obtained [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people), work by Pablo Medina-Suarez and Manuel J. Marin-Jimenez. It has to be placed on the ``models/`` directory on the root of the cloned repository directory, and converted by running the script ``convert_ssd_512.py``.
* SSD model converter can also be obtained as a standalone software [here](https://github.com/AVAuco/ssd_people_keras).
